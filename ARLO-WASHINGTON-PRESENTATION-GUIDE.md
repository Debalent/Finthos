### **6. COMPREHENSIVE Q&A PREPARATION**

#### **🔥 LIKELY BUYER QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:**

**Q: "What's the total cost of ownership?"**

**Q: "What about regulatory compliance?"**
**A:** *"This was built compliance-first. We have PCI DSS Level 1 architecture, GDPR privacy controls, and SOX-compliant audit trails. Your compliance team will love this."*

**A:** *"Everything - source code, documentation, deployment guides, compliance frameworks, architectural decisions, and 90 days of technical support for your team's onboarding."*

**Q: "How is this different from building internally?"**
**A:** *"Your team would need 18-24 months and $800K+ to build this from scratch. Plus, we've already solved the hard problems - compliance integration, security architecture, scalability patterns."*

**Q: "What ongoing support do you provide?"**
**A:** *"90 days of technical transition support, architectural guidance, and documentation walkthroughs for your development team. After that, it's completely yours."*

**Q: "How quickly can we go live?"**
